# CBSH2
 Improved Heuristics for Multi-Agent Path Finding with Conflict-Based Search.
 
 The main goal is to improve heuristics for Conflict-Based Search by reasoning about pairwise dependencies between agents. The code is tested on both Ubuntu and Windows.
 
 The code requires the external library BOOST (https://www.boost.org/).
 
 After you installed BOOST and downloaded the source code, go into the directory of the source code and compile the code with CMake: 
```
cmake .
make
```

Then, you are able to run the code:
```
./CBSH2 -m instances/lak503d.map -a instances/lak503dmap-100agents-2.agents -o test.csv -t 60 -s 1 -h WDG -r 1
```

You can find details and explanations for all parameters with:
```
./CBSH2 --help
```
